# Data Snapshot

The deliverables folder does not contain the data files. This page says where they are and what they contain.

## Location

`data/` is a byte-identical frozen copy of the preprocessing outputs, taken on 2026-09-21 and verified by SHA-256 (`manifest.sha256` in that directory). Modelling code reads only from this snapshot, never from `preprocessing/outputs/`.

| File | Shape | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `patient_features_unimputed.csv.gz` | 11,833 × 1,475 (RecordID + 1,474 features), NaN kept | L4 tree models |
| `X_train_imputed.csv.gz` | 8,283 × 1,475, train-median imputed | L1, L3 |
| `X_validation_imputed.csv.gz` | 1,775 × 1,475 | L1, L3 |
| `X_test_imputed.csv.gz` | 1,775 × 1,475 | L1, L3 |
| `labels_and_baselines.csv` | RecordID, In-hospital_death, split, saps_i, saps_i_available, sofa, sofa_available | all rungs |
| `feature_dictionary.csv` | one row per feature: parameter, window, statistic, unit, missing semantics | reference |
| `split_summary.csv` | rows / deaths / prevalence per split | reference |
| `preprocessing_state.json` | column order, schema hash, fill values | reference |

Splits: train 8,283 / validation 1,775 / test 1,775 (70/15/15), stratified by outcome, seed 20260907. Prevalence 0.1443.

## Provenance

- **Raw data**: PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2012, all 12,000 stays (sets A, B, C pooled), from `Group_project/release/`. 167 stays with negative length of stay excluded upstream.
- **Preprocessing**: teammate's pipeline, documented in `Group_project/preprocessing/README.md`. Validation history in `Group_project/preprocessing_validation_report.md`, `preprocessing_fix_plan.md`, `phase1_2_implementation_summary_v2.md`, `phase3_implementation_summary.md`.
- **Imputation**: train-median only, computed on the 8,283 training rows. No scaling applied; L3 scripts fit `StandardScaler` on train inside the script.
- **Excluded from the matrix**: SAPS-I, SOFA, Length_of_stay, Survival. SAPS-I and SOFA are provided separately in `labels_and_baselines.csv` for the L2 rung only.

## Feature layout (1,474)

| Group | Count |
|---|---|
| 37 dynamic parameters × 3 windows × 12 statistics | 1,338 |
| Merged blood pressure (3 streams × 3 windows × 12 statistics) | 108 |
| Static descriptors incl. BMI and missing indicators | 16 |
| Record-level counters (3 per window) | 9 |
| Arterial-line indicator (1 per window) | 3 |

Windows: `0_24h`, `24_48h`, `0_48h`. Statistics: `measured`, `count`, `first`, `last`, `min`, `max`, `mean`, `median`, `std`, `slope_per_hour`, `delta`, `time_span_hours`. Urine additionally has `total`.

## Things that will bite

- `-1` in SAPS-I / SOFA means "not computable", not a score. `labels_and_baselines.csv` already converts it to NaN plus an `_available` flag. 47 (SAPS-I) and 42 (SOFA) test patients are affected; they have about twice the average mortality.
- `RecordID` is column 1 of every matrix. Drop it before fitting.
- The imputed files are already split; do not filter them by `split` again.
- `patient_features_48h_inclusive_affected_rows.csv.gz` is a sensitivity-check file, not extra training data.
